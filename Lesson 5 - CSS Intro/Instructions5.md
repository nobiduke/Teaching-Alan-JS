# CSS Introduction
Did you see how the webpage that we created from the previous lesson looked very bad? That is because we were missing CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and it is how you style a website.

CSS is how you create a website that looks pleasant and easy on the eyes which is ironic because CSS is very difficult to master.

I am not good at CSS, but I can at least show the basics. Any specific questions, you will have to look up, but there are many resources which is nice.

1. CSS is a collection of objects defined by curly brackets with names

    Example:
    `.className{color: #FF0000;}`

    In this example we are creating a CSS class called `className`. In this class we are changing the color to a hexidecimal value of **<span style="color: #FF0000;">#FF0000</span>**.

2. Classes can then be accessed by your html when you link your CSS. There is an absolute ton that CSS can do so its really better for you to just look up what you want to do as you go. I will give a few examples in index.html. Don't worry too much about how the elements are being attached to which classes. I will go over that in the next lesson.

3. Your assignment is to change the text color of any element to **<span style="color:##00FF00;">GREEN</span>** ðŸŸ©

**DON'T FORGET TO LINK YOUR CSS IN THE HEAD**
