# Attributes in HTML
Alright, so I haven't been completely honest so far. I have been calling the features in HTML that we have been using "elements". In reality, elements are only the content that the page is displaying. The things that we have been using are "tags" which are composed of an element and attributes. Attributes are the text within the tag that specificies certain traits that the element will have. An example of the attribute is the `class` attribute that we used in the previous lesson to link our element to a CSS class.

1. Your job is to modify index.html
2. You are going to create an `id` for the span at the bottom and name it "Target".
3. Lastly, you are going to click the link at the top. If the page does not jump, then you have either typed the id name wrong, or implemented the attribute wrong. Linking to an id is done by placing "#*ID*" at the end of the hyperlink.
