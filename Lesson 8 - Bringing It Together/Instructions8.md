# Bringing it all together

Now that you have the tools to make a full blown web page, lets get a little fancy.

1. First, create an index.html file and fill in the boiler plate.
2. Next fill in the required elements to make a list of tasks.
3. Next create an input element and button element in order to add more tasks.
4. The last step is to add a JavaScript file that will handle the adding of tasks.
5. If you succeed in making the todo list. Try implementing a way to clear out tasks.

Only look at the answer after you are done.

**Bonus Point**: Style it up with some CSS
