# Html Boilerplate
1. There isn't anything to complete for this one. Just read the html page. Everything outside of `<body></body>` will be on almost every single html page that you create.
2. If you have vscode, you can download the html extension and then when you have a new page, press `!` + `Enter` and it will make all of this for you.
3. Everything within `<body></body>` will be your actual viewable page. This is where your "elements go".
4. Not every, but most elements work by having an opening and closing tag that holds its information `<>THE INFORMATION</>`
5. Every element can be placed into another element for interesting interactions

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|`<head></head>`|This is where you meta information goes. This is also how you change the tab name/icon|
|`<body></body>`|This is where the bulk of your page goes. Anything the user sees on the page is placed withing these tags|
|`<></>`|This is an empty holder, doesn't affect how anything looks, but can be used to identify an area. Also helpful in REACT for creating a singular element from many|
|`<div></div>`|This is a divider that is used to create different sections. These are used close to if not on the outside of your other elements|
|`<span></span>`|Similar to a div, but usually used down the line more as they don't create a new line in between|
|`<button></button>`|Pretty self explanatory. Used to create some kind of event by being pressed|
|`<p></p>`|Paragraph, another text holder like span, but creates a new line and has additional formatting|
|`<a href="YOUR-LINK"></a>`|Used to hyper link to some specified link|
|`<img src="LINK-TO-THE-IMAGE">`|Used to link an image to you page|
|`<marquee></marquee>`|Not actually too useful, but fun to look at in a raw HTML page|
|`<br>`|Line break|
|`<code></code>`|Formats the text to look a little different|
